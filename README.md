# ðŸš‡ MRT Station Vulnerability & Connectivity Dashboard

This is an interactive R Shiny dashboard that visualizes **Vulnerability** and **Connectivity** scores of MRT stations across Singapore.

This project aims to identify which MRT stations require the most attention when the Land Transport Authority (LTA) seeks to enhance Singaporeâ€™s transportation network.

##### ðŸ”— You can access the interactive dashboard [here](https://3trgty-ng-yun0xuan.shinyapps.io/ChooChooTrain/).
